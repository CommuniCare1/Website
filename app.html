                            <p>Users can make an account in the Communicare app and provide basic information such as address, phone number, distance preferences, insurance status, and others. When you want to find healthcare resources in your area, simply use our map feature and filter recommendations based on the services required.
                              The app's machine learning based algorithm will recommend tailored resources based on your preferences. For more information, visit the "how it works" page.</p>

                            <p>Communicare is designed to serve low-income and historically under-resourced communities. Our goal is to ensure that these individuals are not left behind in the healthcare system. By increasing awareness and utilization of existing resources, we hope to alleviate the burden of preventable diseases within these communities.
